# Big Sur Status Area

### This is a fork of __[panel-indicators](https://github.com/lvitals/panel-indicators "lvitals Repository")__ y __[panel-indicator](https://github.com/lenuswalker/panel-indicators "lenuswalker Repository")__ that I have modified to bring the macOS Big Sur "System Tray" look to Gnome, moving the Gnome panel icons to the "Status Area", separating the icons and giving a better appearance to the Gnome Shell. This is still a work in progress, so I will be adding new things over time.



## INSTALLATION


There are two ways to install the extension on your distro with Gnome Desktop; the first is manually, the second, and easier, is the installation from the official page of [Gnome Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/)

### Manual Installation

To do a manual installation, all you have to do is download the extension from [Big Sur Status Area](https://www.pling.com/p/1427290/ "Big Sur Status Area on Gnome Look") and unzip the file to obtain a folder that you must move to the path: 

`/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`

To see the `/.local/` folder you need to access the hidden files and for that you must first press the `"ctrl + h"` keys or go to the Nautilus menu and check the `Show Hidden Files` box.


### Installation from Gnome Extensions (SOON...!)

To install from the Gnome Extensions page, go to the following link: [Big Sur Status Area](https://extensions.gnome.org/ "Big Sur Status Area on Gnome Extensions") and turn on the extension, then confirm the installation and voila, you already have the Big Sur Status Area in Gnome Desktop.


### CONFIGURING THE EXTENSION

To achieve the Big Sur look with the Big Sur Status Area extension, go to Settings and then to `"Position and size"`, check the `"Calendar" to be moved to the left`, then follow the following order from bottom to top : `Calendar, User, Notification, Volume, Network, Night Light, Bluetooth, Power (Brightness).`
Then go to the `"Settings"` tab and paste the following time format for the clock: `% a% b% d% H:% M% p.`

You can also choose to show the battery percentage in case of being a Laptop, obviously; it can also display username instead of icon on panel.


## I hope you enjoy this extension on your top panel and all its functions are useful in your everyday work };-]
